# Car Mileage Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview

This project, completed during my internship at YBI Organization, involves analyzing a dataset on car mileage (MPG.csv) and building a predictive model using linear regression. The aim is to understand the relationships between various car features and their impact on mileage (mpg) and to predict the mileage based on these features.

## Project Structure

- **milage_analysis.py**: The main script for data analysis and model building.
- **MPG.csv**: The dataset used for the project (fetched from a URL).

## Features and Analysis

### Data Analysis

1. **Loading Data**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   milage = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset/raw/main/MPG.csv')
   ```

2. **Initial Exploration**:
   - Display the first few rows:
     ```python
     milage.head()
     ```
   - Check the number of unique values:
     ```python
     milage.nunique()
     ```
   - Data summary:
     ```python
     milage.info()
     milage.describe()
     ```

3. **Correlation and Columns**:
   - Check correlation between variables:
     ```python
     milage.corr()
     ```
   - List of columns:
     ```python
     milage.columns
     ```

### Data Visualization

1. **Pairplot**:
   ```python
   import seaborn as sns
   sns.pairplot(milage, x_vars=['displacement', 'horsepower', 'weight', 'acceleration', 'mpg'], y_vars=['mpg'])
   ```

2. **Regression Plot**:
   ```python
   sns.regplot(x='displacement', y='mpg', data=milage)
   ```

### Data Preparation

1. **Feature Selection**:
   ```python
   y = milage['mpg']
   x = milage[['displacement', 'horsepower', 'weight', 'acceleration']]
   ```

2. **Standardization**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   ss = StandardScaler()
   x = ss.fit_transform(x)
   ```

### Model Building

1. **Train-Test Split**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   x_train, x_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(x, y)
   ```

2. **Linear Regression**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
   lr = LinearRegression()
   lr.fit(x_train, Y_train)
   y_pred = lr.predict(x_test)
   ```

### Model Evaluation

1. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_absolute_error, mean_absolute_percentage_error
   mean_absolute_error(Y_test, y_pred)
   mean_absolute_percentage_error(Y_test, y_pred)
   r2_score(Y_test, y_pred)
   ```

## Results

- **Model Coefficients**:
  ```python
  lr.coef_
  ```
- **Model Intercept**:
  ```python
  lr.intercept_
  ```
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
  - R-squared (R2)

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of data analysis and model building using linear regression. It provides insights into the relationships between car features and mileage, and the developed model can predict the mileage based on these features.
